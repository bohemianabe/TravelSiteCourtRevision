Hey I was able to get some things fixed on your code. It runs for the most part now. Just wanted to note that the mistakes I found just seemed to be things that were rushed. I know because they look like the same mistakes I make when I rush. I know Ed goes fast in his tutorials, so I pause a bajillion times and rewind. Most of your mistakes were just poor syntax. Coding is fickle with any missing punctuation. If you see anything underlined in red on the IDE definitely take a look at it, and the things around it. It's like a game of clue with JS. Also use you web browser and the console for clues. Otherwise it was good. I also left other notes sprinkled throughout the code in app, index, and style. Happy coding!
